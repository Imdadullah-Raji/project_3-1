# Project MuADDiBSS: Multi-Agent Doubly Decentralized Bio-inspired Swarms System

Project MuADDiBSS is hybrid autonomous system comprising of an intelligent and perceptive drone equipped with a raspberry pi 4 as an onboard computer, and a leader
ground bot which communicates with the drone using LoRa SX1278 Ra-02 module and commands swarm units by using ESP32-IDFs IoT capabilites. 

## File Details 

-The folder both_bot_codes contains code for the leader, and also the swarm unit 
- There is a file for autonomous drone flights using python library MAVSDK
